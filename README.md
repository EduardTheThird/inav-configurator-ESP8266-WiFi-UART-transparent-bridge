Transparent serial communication sketch in Arduino IDE.  

Is anyone interested in serial communication over the internet?  
[ESP8266-Azure-IoT-Hub-UART-transparent-bridge ](https://github.com/NaoNaoMe/ESP8266-Azure-IoT-Hub-UART-transparent-bridge) might be a good example.

This sketch used with [RM Classic](https://github.com/NaoNaoMe/RM-Classic).  
You could find a tutorial on my [youtube channel](https://youtu.be/QDO9URz7r5U).  

People who visit this repository might be interested in the [UartWiFiBoard](https://github.com/NaoNaoMe/Uart-WiFi-Board).

The UartWiFiBoard is battery-powered stand-alone uart-wifi board so that the board can establish connection wifi network by itself.  
You can communicate uart data over wifi, when you connect to the board's ip address by terminal apps.  
When you send messages to the board's ip address, the board transmit uart data to your target and vice-versa.
